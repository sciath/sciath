# PythonTestHarness: The idea #

Testing code should be easy. The functionality required to launch, parse and perform the verification should be light-weight and simple to migrate into existing projects. Support test codes which uses MPI, and which may be executed via a batch queuing system must be provided.

### Key concepts ###

PTH provides:

* An object to define a unit test. A "unit test" consists of (i) a textual name, (ii) an executable, (iii) a method to compare any output generated by the test (e.g. from stdout or anyother output file)
* A set of tools to parse / filter and query text files for verification purposes
* An object to manage launching a serial (or MPI) unit test through a batch queuing system

### How do I use this crap? ###

Make sure you set PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the directory where the ```pth_{test,batch}.py``` files live.

* Demonstration of basic unit-testing for serial tests. 
Features: 
(i) comparison with data in a file
  
  
  python3.4 example1/pth_example1.py

  

* Demonstration of basic unit-testing for serial tests.
Features:
(i) tests are in separate directories;
(ii) tests can be optionally selected
  
 
  python3.4 example2/pth_example2.py
  


* Demonstration of parallel tests using PETSc code. 
Features:
(i) Batch queuing system with parallel runs

  
  python3.4 example3/pth_example3.py
