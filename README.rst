SciATH: Scientific Application Test Harness
===========================================

The Idea
--------

Testing code should be easy. The functionality required to launch, parse
and perform verification should be light-weight and simple to migrate
into existing projects. SciATH supports testing of sequential and
MPI-parallel applications. Tests can be performed locally, or submitted
via a batch queuing system (e.g. PBS, LSF, Slurm or LoadLeveler).

Key Concepts
------------

SciATH provides:

-  An object to define a test. A “test” consists of:

   -  a unique textual name;
   -  one or more executables;
   -  a number of MPI ranks (1 for serial execution)
   -  a text file containing the expected output;
   -  a method to compare any output generated by the test (e.g. from
      stdout or another output file)

-  A set of tools to parse / filter and query text files for test
   verification purposes
-  A “harness” object to quickly define and process a set of tests
-  Internally, a “launcher” object to manage launching a serial or MPI
   job locally or via a batch queuing system

How do I use this ?
-------------------

1. SciATH depends on Python 3 (or Python 2.4+) and numpy

2. When using Python 3, it is highly recommended you set the environment
   variable PYTHONUNBUFFERED, e.g. ``export PYTHONUNBUFFERED``

3. Make sure you modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include
   the directory ``${PWD}/lib`` (relative to this README file)

Documentation and Tutorials
---------------------------

See TODO: link to readthedocs once repo is public (for now, build the docs locally), and remove the redundant material remaining in this README.
