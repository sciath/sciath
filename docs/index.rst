What is it?
===========

pyTestHarness is a set of lightweight Python tools designed to quickly and easily test scientific application codes. As such,
it focuses on full-application testing
and prioritizes being able to run on clusters with batch systems.
This is in contrast to most testing frameworks, which are designed with libraries in mind.
